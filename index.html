		<div class="display-4 text-center mx-auto">Topic: Basic of Web?</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is Internet?</h2>
	<p>The Internet is essentially a global network of computing resources. You can think of the Internet as a physical collection of routers and circuits as a set of shared resources.</p>
	<p>Some common definitions given in the past include –</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A network of networks based on the TCP/IP communications protocol.</li>
		<li>A community of people who use and develop those networks.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">Internet-Based Services:</h2>
	<p>Some of the basic services available to Internet users are −</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Email:</strong> A fast, easy, and inexpensive way to communicate with other Internet users around the world.</li>
		<li><strong>Telnet:</strong> Allows a user to log into a remote computer as though it were a local system.</li>
		<li><strong>FTP:</strong> Allows a user to transfer virtually every kind of file that can be stored on a computer from one Internet-connected computer to another.</li>
		<li><strong>UseNet News:</strong> A distributed bulletin board that offers a combination news and discussion service on thousands of topics</li>
		<li><strong>World Wide Web (WWW):</strong> A hypertext interface to Internet information resources.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is WWW?</h2>
	<p>WWW stands for World Wide Web. A technical definition of the World Wide Web is − All the resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). <br>A broader definition comes from the organization that Web inventor <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> helped found, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge. <br>In simple terms, The World Wide Web is a way of exchanging information between computers   on the Internet, tying them together into a vast collection of interactive multimedia resources.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is HTTP?</h2>
	<p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is the protocol being used to transfer hypertext documents that makes the World Wide Web possible. <br>A standard web address such as https://www.google.com/  is called a URL and here the prefix  http indicates its protocol</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is URL?</h2>
	<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, and is used to specify addresses on the World Wide Web. A URL is the fundamental network identification for any resource connected to the web (e.g., hypertext pages, images, and sound files).</p>
	
	<p>A URL will have the following format: <mark>protocol://hostname/other_information</mark></p>
	
	<p>The protocol specifies how information is transferred from a link. The protocol used for web resources is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Other protocols compatible with most web browsers include FTP, telnet, newsgroups, and Gopher. <br> The protocol is followed by a colon, two slashes, and then the domain name. The domain name    is the computer on which the resource is located. <br>Links to particular files or subdirectories may be further specified after the domain name. The directory names are separated by single forward slashes.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is Website?</h2>
	<p>Collection of various pages written in HTML markup language is called a website. This is a location on the web where people can find information on latest technologies. Similarly, there are millions of websites available on the web. <br>Each page available on the website is called a web page and first page of any website is called home page for that site.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is Web Server?</h2>
	<p>Every Website sits on a computer known as a Web server. This server is always connected to the internet. Every Web server that is connected to the Internet is given a unique address made up of   a series of four numbers between 0 and 256 separated by periods. <b>For example:</b> 68.178.157.132 or 68.122.35.127. <br>When you register a Web address, also known as a domain name, such as ecti.co.in you have to specify the IP address of the Web server that will host the site.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is Web Browser?</h2>
	<p>Web Browsers are software installed on your PC. To access the Web you need web browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. On the Web, when you navigate through pages of information this is commonly known as browsing or surfing.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is Web Browser?</h2>
	<p>Web Browsers are software installed on your PC. To access the Web you need web browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. On the Web, when you navigate through pages of information this is commonly known as browsing or surfing.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is SMTP Server?</h2>
	<p>SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Server. This server takes care of delivering emails from one server to another server. When you send an email to an email address, it is delivered to its recipient by a SMTP Server</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is ISP?</h2>
	<p>ISP stands for Internet Service Provider. They are the companies who provide you service in terms of internet connection to connect to the internet. You will buy space on a Web Server from any Internet Service Provider. This space will be used to host your Website.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is DNS?</h2>
	<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. When someone types in your domain name, www.example.com, your browser will ask the Domain Name System to find the  IP that hosts  your site. When you register your domain name, your IP address should be put in a DNS along with your domain name. Without doing it your domain name will not be functioning properly.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What is W3C?</h2>
	<p>W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium which is an international consortium of companies involved with the Internet and the Web. <br>The W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the original architect of the World Wide Web. The organization's purpose is to develop open standards so that the Web evolves in a single direction rather than being splintered among competing factions. The W3C is the chief standards body for HTTP and HTML.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">How Web Works?</h2>
	<p>On the simplest level, the Web physically consists of the following components:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Your personal computer:</b> This is the PC at which you sit to see the web.</li>
		<li><b>A Web browser:</b> Software installed on your PC which helps you to browse the Web.</li>		
		<li><b>An internet connection:</b> This is provided by an ISP and connects you to the internet to reach to any Website.</li>
		<li><b>A Web server:</b> This is the computer on which a website is hosted.</li>
		<li><b>Routers & Switches:</b> They are the combination of software and hardware that take your request and pass to appropriate Web server.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The Web is known as a <b><i>client-server system</i></b>. Your computer is the client and the remote computers that store electronic files are the servers.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">How the Web Works:</h2>
	<p>When you enter something like Google.com the request goes to one of many special computers on the Internet known as Domain Name Servers (DNS). All these requests are routed through various routers and switches. The domain name servers keep tables of machine names and their IP addresses, so when you type in Google.com it gets translated into a number, which identifies the computers that serve the Google Website to you. <br> When you want to view any page on the Web, you must initiate the activity by requesting a page using your browser. The browser asks a domain name server to translate the domain name you requested into an IP address. The browser then sends a request to that server for the page you want, using a standard called Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. <br>The server should constantly be connected to the Internet, ready to serve pages to visitors. When it receives a request, it looks for the requested document and returns it to the Web browser. When a request is made, the server usually logs the client's IP address, the document requested, and the date and time it was requested. This information varies server to server. <br> An average Web page actually requires the Web browser to request more than one file from the Web server and not just the HTML / XHTML page, but also any images, style sheets, and other resources used in the web page. Each of these files including the main page needs a URL to identify each item. Then each item is sent by the Web server to the Web browser and Web browser collects all this information and displays them in the form of Web page.</p>
	<b>In Short - </b>
	<p>We have seen how a Web client - server interaction happens. We can summarize these steps as follows −</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A user enters a URL into a browser (for example, Google.com. This request is passed to a domain name server.</li>
		<li>The domain name server returns an IP address for the server that hosts the Website (for example, 68.178.157.132).</li>
		<li>The browser requests the page from the Web server using the IP address specified by the domain name server.</li>
		<li>The Web server returns the page to the IP address specified by the browser requesting the page. The page may also contain links to other files on the same server, such as images, which the browser will also request.</li>
		<li>The browser collects all the information and displays to your computer  in the form of  Web page.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">Web Browser:</h2>
	<p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the resulting web page on the user's device. <br>Some of the popular Web Browser is as follows: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">Web Server:</h2>
	<p>A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.</p>

	</div>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">Scope of Web Designing – Past, Present and Future</h2>
	<p>When you hear the word “the web,” what crosses your mind? For me, it would be a beautifully designed aesthetic website that has some appealing colors, images, videos and a little bit of information. That is all that the web means for most of us. Some people take it to posting selfies on their Instagram and Facebook profiles and let me do some guesswork here; the web is all about selfying for these people. Posting selfies, updating statuses, online shopping, or E-learning, whatever we do, undoubtedly today the web is an inseparable part of our lives. <br>Let us not underestimate the power of web designs and the geniuses of web designers in weaving the web magic.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">Here the question is what about the scope and future of Web Design?</h2>
	<p>If someone were to ask this question to me, I would say that it is infinite. Now web Designers   you will never be out of a job because the internet needs you for its survival and vice-versa. Your career may get sealed if one fine morning the internet decides to fade away. Sounds rude! But, unfortunately, that is a bitter truth and forms one of our worst nightmares. No worries! Your job   is safe! The internet has no plans to quit at present. So, enjoy and be proud to be a webie. <br> Let me cheer you up with some awesome news about my anticipations and expert views on what the future and scope of the web will be. I can assure you that the Internet will continue ruling the world with 100% confidence. I don’t know how many of you are aware of the fact that the first kind of the Internet also referred to as the Intranet came to be launched somewhere around the 1960’s. Since then there has been no looking back though there has been inevitable and unprecedented progress every other day. <br>And, we are all living evidence of this growth that continues to dominate millions of people all around the world.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">The evolution of the first website:</h2>
	<p>I have done my research before I set out to help you, and my sources reveal that Tim Berners- Lee was the person to create the first website design as early as in the 90’s. To be precise the exact date when the world got its first website is on the 1st of August, 1991. Almost 28 years   have gone by since the first site was launched. Have you ever wondered what your first website was like?</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">Emergence of the World Wide Web Consortium:</h2>
	<p>Commonly known as the W3 Consortium, which came to be formed in the year 1994 brought along with it the standardization of the web. Its qualified HTML as the standard for marking up web pages. <br>As time passed, several changes evolved, and we got table-based designs, followed by design over structure, flash-based web designs, Macromedia Shockwave, DHTML, 3DML, CSS-Based designs and what not.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">Future of Web Designs:</h2>
	<p>Let me be frank with the things, as we have discussed the Internet has its roots of origin to somewhere back in the year 1969 and it took almost more than 50 years for it to evolve and    reach the common man all around the world. So, my point is there are several things around us, and it takes not more than a minimum of 25-30 years for it to become a trend and an inseparable part of our lives. <br> Let me take some other examples that include the CTSS Mail Service, which came to be launched in the year 1965 but it was not until in the 1990’s that Email services became available for people all over the world. <br> Similarly, the wearable computers that have become quite a trend now have its origin somewhere in the 1980’s and today Apple iWatch, Google Glasses and all are a part of our lives. <br>So, what you are doing today will become a trend for years to come. <br>These are examples of technology though the design is an equally important thing. For that  matter, if you check out the WordPress plugins that we use, each has evolved over time with an improvement in its functionality and beauty.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">How can we connect technology and web design?</h2>
	<p>As  you  see  the  kind  of  web  designs  that  we  have  are responsive, single   page   web   design, material design, card design, etc. The need for different types of designs depends on the content that you are viewing and the kind of device that is being used to view the content. Some might use desktops, laptops, tablets, or mobile for accessing the websites.</p>
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">What can we expect in 20 years from now?</h2>
	<p>The way we analyze and interpret information will take a different change. A website is nothing but something that showcases data or information. Imagine having a small chip or card placed in your memory that will bring you the reflection of anything and everything you wish to reach out. It means there will be no more the need for creating web pages or websites. Because we have turned ourselves into human-bots, that can feed information into our memories.</p>
	
	
	<h2 class="text-muted font-weight-normal pt-4">So, what is the scope of your job web designers?</h2>
	<p>It looks like you need to find another job for your bread and butter once we enter the Contextual Age. So is the case with Content Writers and others, because the context of viewing data and others are changing and you have to change. But again, as I said these are all my weird imaginations out of my weird memory box. So, let us examine what is happening around us:</p>
	<p><b>Outsourcing or in-house:</b> These days outsourcing has become quite irrelevant. People establish in-house web design and development teams to get the work done. But, outsourcing is not dead.</p>
	<p><b>Tools and Technologies: </b>Technology is ever evolving. As a result, Web designs based on these technologies would also need to be redefined with every evolutionary phase. Nevertheless,  there are  several  standard tools which would always be in demand by Web Designers. This includes:
		<ul>
			<li>HTML and CSS</li>
			<li>WYSIWYG editors like Adobe Dreamweaver</li>
			<li>Graphic Editors like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator</li>
			<li>Programming skills</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p><b>Career Opportunities for web designers: </b>Web Designing is a promising career opportunity which displays immense scope for interested candidates. In India, one of the biggest industries, which provides a possible room for Web Designing as a career opportunity is the IT or the software industry. Clients interested in getting their online presence established are approaching the software giants to get their Web sites designed. Therefore, the software stalwarts recruit experienced professionals who would be sufficiently qualified in executing the deliverables in quick turnaround time. <br>Also, they also welcome Fresher’s, who are put through rigorous training and then made to learn the ropes under the wings of the experienced seniors. This provides them with an excellent opportunity to learn the work hands-on. <br>Most organizations also recruit web designers for their internal projects which have a distinct flavor of their own as it provides the opportunity for Designers to interact with major company stakeholders who run these internal initiatives. <br>Web Designers are also required in the Media Industry like News or advertising agencies or even in the education industry developing educational websites and learning material for students.</p>
	
	<p><b>Future Roadmap: </b>With such a wide canvas it is little wonder that Web Designers can etch out a promising roadmap for the future. Designers need to evolve beyond rigid design boards and emerge as architects of a new change which is redefining the traditional concepts of Web Design. <br>Mobility first, Responsive Designs, Minimalist look, Content first approach are the new terminologies which need to be carved on their easel broadening their canvas a tad bit more. The onus is on them taking the cue and sketch out the new roadmap for the future.</p>
